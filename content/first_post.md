It's now more than 5 years from the time that Diffusion Imaging in Python (DIPY) was born. I am very happy to see the project growing fast having now more than 30 amazing people contributing. This international team is truly pushing the limits not only of diffusion MRI but also of medical imaging. This is history in the making!

I have to say here that I was always feeling that this would happen eventually and that the project would be successful. But I didn't know how fast. So, for 5 years I was working unlimited hours, living in the future, and imagining the days were DIPY would be used to unite researchers across borders or lab agendas with the common goal of investigating the structural connectivity of the brain.

The future has arrived and now DIPY is used both in academia and industry with surprising results. I will be posting news here and the DIPY website.

This is one of the pictures I made using DIPY but with a twist. I changed the standard colormap of the streamlines to make them look more vintage and more artistic. There is a suppressed artist hidden in all scientists. I am not an
exception ;)

In this blog, I will continue posting ideas and news about Medical Imaging, Diffusion MRI, DIPY and other topics that I believe are interesting.

Thank you for visiting my website.
