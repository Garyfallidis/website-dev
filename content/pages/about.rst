About

I am a Greek computer scientist with a PhD in brain imaging from the University of Cambridge, and I am currently working as a Postdoctoral researcher at the wonderful and dynamic lab of Professor Maxime Descoteaux, at the University of Sherbrooke in Canada.

In 2009, I started a free and open source Python project called DIPY. DIPY focuses on advancing our current understanding of brain mapping using diffusion MRI (dMRI). dMRI is an MRI technique that can be used to study non-invasively the structural connectivity of the brain and other tissue.

Today, DIPY has grown to a multinational and dynamic community with many enthusiastic contributors. Apart from leading the development of DIPY, I have performed research on nearly all levels of dMRI analysis and recently I started concentrating more on the problems of segmentation and registration. In 2013 I also lead a team to win the international IEEE HARDI reconstruction competition. `Here is my CV <../pdfs/garyfallidis_CV_2015.pdf>`_.

The picture on the right is from 2010 at a scientific exhibition that I participated while a PhD student at Cambridge. This was for the celebration of the 350 years of the Royal Society in London, UK. Video link of the demo for the general public is available `here <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNB0sM7JJqg>`_ . This video gives a nice overview of the topic that I am working on without getting into the details.
